# Junit-Test-Demo

Testing Method : 

1- Unit Testing : test individual units/parts and  shows that this part is correct (verify functionality ).
		*units are methods and classes i.e : each unit performs standalone task (single method or single class)
		*this is performed  by developers team .
		*the developer chooses inputs and put the expected output
2- Regression Testing: test the latest fix(whether if code is changed or new functionality or dependencies/packages are added)

2- Integration Testing : test that group og=f modules in project are working fine togother . this test is performed after unit testing . this is performed bt testing team .

3- System testing : test athe all project .


Junit : 
	it is java unit testing framework .
	* it has evolved over time . the best change is the annotaions was added . 
	* Junit 5 was split into 3 modules, one of those being a vintage module that supports annotation/syntax of Junit 4 and 3 (although usage of Junit 3 is frankly dismal 
  and typically seen only in much older projects)
